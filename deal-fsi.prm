# ---------------------
subsection Boundary conditions
  # Gravity in negative y-direction
  set gravity  = 2

  # Traction in negative y-direction
  set traction = 0
end


subsection Output
  # This indicates between how many time steps we print the solution.
  set output_interval = 1

  # This indicates whether the solution is saved in paraview format.
  set output_paraview = true
end


subsection Physical constants
  # Young's modulus
  set E   = 1.4e6

  # Poisson ratio
  set nu  = 0.4

  # Density
  set rho = 1000.0
end


subsection Space discretization
  # The polynomial degree for the displacement space.
  set fe_degree    = 1

  # The number of global refines we do on the mesh.
  set n_of_refines = 0
end


subsection Time step data
  # Time step size
  set dt         = 2.5e-3

  # Final time of the simulation
  set final_time = 0.05

  # i.e. backward Euler, forward Euler or Crank-Nicolson.
  set theta      = 1.0
